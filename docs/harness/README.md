# Mnemon Harness Public Beta

`mnemon-harness` is an experimental beta for installing host integration assets
and connecting them to a local Mnemon service.

Stable Mnemon remains the memory CLI. The harness is source-build only, has no
compatibility guarantee, and is currently scoped to Agent Integration, Local
Mnemon, standard event packages, and Remote Workspace sync.

## 1. Product Surface

The user-facing command surface is intentionally small:

- `setup`: install Agent Integration assets.
- `local`: run or inspect Local Mnemon.
- `status`: show Agent Integration, Local Mnemon, and Remote Workspace state.
- `sync`: connect Local Mnemon to a Remote Workspace.

Other implementation commands are internal and are not part of the beta product
contract.

## 2. Current Scope

The beta supports Codex and Claude Code projections. Projected host directories
such as `.codex/` and `.claude/` are generated surfaces. Local state lives under
`.mnemon/harness/`.

The current beta does not promise production readiness, automatic apply,
multi-agent governance, broad organization scope, or a general evaluation
runtime.

Architecture vocabulary for new harness work is frozen in
[`protocol-vocabulary-freeze.md`](protocol-vocabulary-freeze.md). Use that
document when naming new protocol concepts or reviewing architecture changes.

## 3. Separation From Stable Mnemon

`mnemon-harness` is built from `./harness/cmd/mnemon-harness`.

Stable `mnemon` behavior is unchanged unless a user explicitly opts into harness
event emission or runs `mnemon-harness` directly.

## 4. Try It

Build both binaries:

```sh
go build -o mnemon .
go build -o mnemon-harness ./harness/cmd/mnemon-harness
```

Install Agent Integration for a project:

```sh
./mnemon-harness setup --host codex --project-root .
./mnemon-harness local run
./mnemon-harness status
```

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for command examples.

## 5. Release Boundary

This beta intentionally ships minimal public documentation. Internal planning,
experimental command surfaces, generated site HTML, and future governance
experiments are not part of the product contract.
